                <h1>Cortadillo (Mexican Pink Cake)</h1>
                <p class="description">When I think of home, the <i>merienda</i>, or evening snack, is one of the first things that comes to mind. Every Sunday after mass, we visit my Abuelita and Tía, the latter of whom bakes a different dessert to share with us every week over <i>merienda</i>. Though they're all delicious, the cortadillo, or "pink cake," has to be one of my all-time favorites. It is a vanilla cake topped with bright pink icing and rainbow sprinkles. Though most recipes dye the icing with pink food coloring, the thing I love most about my Tía's recipe is that she uses strawberry flavored Nesquik instead, giving the icing a light pink color and subtle strawberry flavor. Yields 12 servings.</p>

                <h3>Cake</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>6 eggs</li>
                    <li>2 cups of granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>3 1/2 cups of flour</li>
                    <li>1 3/4 cups of vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups of whole milk</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Icing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 1/2 tablespoons of whole milk</li>
                    <li>1 cup of powdered sugar</li>
                    <li>2 or 3 tablespoons of Nesquik Strawberry Powder Mix</li>
                    <li>Rainbow sprinkles, amount to your liking</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 340°F.</li>
                    <li>Mix the eggs with the granulated sugar (can be mixed by hand or with electric mixer).</li>
                    <li>Stream in the vegetable oil and mix.</li>
                    <li>Add and mix together the flour and baking powder, then add and mix the 1 1/2 cups of whole milk and vanilla extract. Mix well, but be careful not to overbeat.</li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture into a deep, greased pan. Bake in the oven at 340°F for about 30 minutes, or until a golden brown color.</li>
                    <li>Once removed from the oven, let the cake cool completely.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, combine the powdered sugar and the Nesquik Strawberry Powder Mix.</li>
                    <li>Add the 3 1/2 tablespoons of whole milk little by little, or until the icing reaches your desired consistency.</li>
                    <li>Pour the icing over the cooled cake into an even layer.</li>
                    <li>Top with rainbow sprinkles.</li>
                    <li>Slice and serve. When cut into triangles the cortadillo can yield about 12 servings, but you can cut into squares for more or smaller servings based on your preference.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2 class="subheading">Recipe Site References</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/">Food Network</a> - Another staple of my childhood. The Food Network website and its recipe pages are intuitive, allowing users to explore by providing links to other or similar recipes. Something I enjoy about the page design of each recipe is that many of the elements are arranged to be in-line, meaning that the list of ingredients is visible alongside the instructions, and hierarchies are established through the use of color and strategically applied font variations.</li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="https://www.epicurious.com/">Epicurious</a> - Contains website layouts very similar to Food Network's, but I felt there was more of an "openness" that Food Network's site didn't have. I liked that the page title and main recipe image are arranged in-line, a move that creates a bold first impression that compels the reader to keep scrolling.</li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/">Bon Appétit</a> - This page, I felt, combined elements of the previous two websites that I was inspired by. Something that made for a more pleasant user experience was that the drop-down menu on the homepage for "Recipes" included categories and subcategories for specific types of dishes and occasions. The only in-line elements on the recipe pages themselves were the title and main image, and the rest were block elements—this allows the reader to proceed with the recipe in a chronological order.</li>
                <br>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="subheading">Non-Recipe Site References</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a> - This website's article pages are actually designed pretty similarly to those of the recipe websites: in-line title and main image lead into the body text. It's a popular strategy for a reason, but I like that, at least on web, there's a lot of white space around the centered body text that allows my eyes to relax around the text.</li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="https://www.juankafka.com/">Juan Villanueva Portfolio</a> - This was a site I found when doing research for a typography project. Villanueva's type designs unfold in a series of different pages, and while I don't think my recipe page would need all of these fancy animations, I think this website is a good example of creating a clear order of operations for the viewer.</li>
                <br>
                <li><a href="https://us.tonyschocolonely.com/">Tony's Chocolonely</a> - A chocolate company with a very clear sense of branding identity. A bright color palette and a reserved use of the brightest yellow for arrows and in-site functions clarifies what the user will get from clicking them.</li>
