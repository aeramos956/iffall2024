        <li>I did some short programming courses in CSS when I was in middle school, but they were a struggle and I might as well be starting from scratch.</li>
        <li>In this class, I want to not only become confident in HTML, CSS, and JS, but be able to apply them to enhance my personal and academic pursuits.</li>
        <li>A printed object like paper is static while the screen, and by extension webpage, is something that can change on a whim and must accommodate for that.</li>
        <li>https://www.nytimes.com/ The New York Times homepage establishes a clear hierarchy of information, plus it adjusts smoothly to any changes in window size.</li>
        <li>https://www.mobobatea.com/ Though the webpage for Moboba in Edinburg, TX has lots of bells and whistles, it communicates the lively atmosphere around their boba and other products.</li>
