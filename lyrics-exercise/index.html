                    <p>How important is it to you</p>
                    <p>If our house that's made out of wood falls down?</p>
                    <p>Was it me who sent you away</p>
                    <p>From our garden made out of clay</p>
                    <p>To search for new terrain?</p>
                    <p>For spaces made from</p>
                    <p>Other houses built out of stone</p>
                    <p>There's a light on, nobody's home</p>
                    <p>To welcome you</p>
                    <p>From the darkness down by the road</p>
                    <p>And nurture you back to</p>
                    <p>Heady foreman at the trigger</p>
                    <p>Swimming backwards up the river</p>
                    <p>From the coastline, to deliver</p>
                    <p>Certainty, honestly</p>

                    <p>If our house and our avenue</p>
                    <p>Were to crumble down to the ground</p>
                    <p>And cover you</p>
                    <p>And cut into</p>
                    <p>and nurture you back to health</p>
